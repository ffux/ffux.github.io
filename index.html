                In my spare time over the past 10 years I have completed self-directed learning
                in creative digital media and have since followed this to a Certificate in Audio Production, and a
                Diploma in
                Software Engineering and Design. I believe this is evident in my creative outlook and agile
                ideologies.</p>
              <p>I always have a personal project on the go where I am challenged to learn new
                practical skills. Currently I find myself sinking time into creating interesting
                custom keyboard designs and firmware using C and compiling with MSYS2.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>2018-Present<br />
          <i>Service Desk Analyst, Datacom</i><br />
          Since joining Datacom I have worked directly with ACC and MBIE and assisted
          with advice on other accounts ranging from Parliamentary Services to
          PostShop. Throughout my time here I have become a guidance point within my
          teams for ITIL practices and ideologies.</p>
        <p>
          The most vital responsibilities in these roles have been first point
          troubleshooting, request fulfilment, high priority incident management and
          relationship management between parties.</p>
        <p>
          The first point troubleshooting responsibility has found me currently trending
          as maintaining the highest first point resolution rate of my team combined
          with the lowest average call handling time. This has escalated to identifying
          issues not currently resolved at the first point across the team and creating
          tools to better enable my colleagues through Active Directory analysis with
          Powershell and automating tasks with scripting.</p>
        <p>
          The request fulfilment element includes identifying end user needs and
          providing options with practical advice and clear explanation of process when
          required.</p>
        <p>
          My high priority incident management responsibilities include raising highdetail tickets and explaining both
          incidents and business impact in a way that
          all parties can understand. I also manage communications between effected
          users and resolver groups where required to enable agile solutions. This sees
          me regularly taking country-impacting priority 1 incidents from beginning to
          end.</p>
        <p>
          Throughout my days I manage relationships with third party vendors and
          contractors working for Datacom’s clients, including representatives from
          Argonaut, DXC Technology, HP, Intergen, Solnet, Vodafone, and many other
          technology partners.</p>
        <p>
          Additional to my everyday responsibilities I have trained and advised
          colleagues in both technical and procedural aspects. Sharing knowledge and
          workflow advice has been one of the most enjoyable parts of my time with
          Datacom so far, as I have witnessed it empower my teams and allow us to
          reach new heights.</p>
        <p>
          Technologies I have worked with in this roles includes Windows Server
          2012/2016, Active Directory, SCCM, Exchange, Office365 systems, Citrix
          (Application/Desktop virtualization), Entrust and Symantec (enterprise security
          solutions), Cisco telephony, CASD R12 (service desk management platform).
          In addition to these I have operationally interacted with Atlassian platforms
          such as Jira and Confluence through supporting MBIE’s adoption internally.</p>
